## Plugin Naming Convention

Plugins must be named with the prefix `ctx-` followed by a descriptive name, e.g., `ctx-git`, `ctx-docker`, `ctx-npm`.

## Plugin Execution

Plugins are executed by the ctx tool without any arguments. They should gather context information based on their specific domain and output the results to stdout.

## Output Format

Plugins must output their results in JSON format. The output should be a single JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "data": {
    // Plugin-specific data structure
  }
}
```

- `name`: The name of the plugin (should match the executable name without the `ctx-` prefix)
- `version`: The version of the plugin
- `data`: An object containing the plugin-specific data structure

## Error Handling

If a plugin encounters an error during execution, it should exit with a non-zero status code and output an error message to stderr.

If a plugin fails for a reason that should be communicated to the user, it should output a JSON object with an `error` field containing the error message and exit with a status code of 1.

```json
{
  "error": "An error occurred while gathering context information."
}
```

## Required Flags

Plugins must support the following flags:

- (no flag): Execute the plugin and gather context information. This is the default behavior when no flags are provided.

## Plugin Capabilities Reporting

Plugins should support a `--capabilities` flag that returns a JSON object describing the plugin's capabilities. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "git",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": [
    "branch_info",
    "commit_history",
    "remote_info"
  ]
}
```

## Plan Relevance

Plugins should implement the `--plan-relevance` flag to specify their relevance to the current context. The output should be a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means not relevant and 1 means highly relevant. For example:

```bash
$ ctx-git --plan-relevance
0.8
```

## Plugin Versioning

Plugins should follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) and maintain compatibility with the ctx version they were developed for. Include a `ctx_version` field in the plugin's capabilities output to indicate compatibility.

## Plugin Configuration

Plugins should support configuration through environment variables or configuration files. Use a consistent prefix (e.g., CTX_PLUGINNAME_) for environment variables and follow the XDG Base Directory Specification for configuration files.

## Security Guidelines

- Validate and sanitize alld input, including command-line arguments and environment variables
- Avoid executingd user-supplied code or commands
- Use secure coding practices, such as param^R
deterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling to^R
 avoid information leakage
- Regularly update dependencies and address known vulnerabilities

## Performance Optimization

- Implement caching mechanisms for expensive operations
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Minimize external process calls and I/O operations
- Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
- Consider implementing parallel processing for independent tasks

## Plugin Documentation

Plugins should include comprehensive documentation, including:

- A README file with installation and usage instructions
- Inline code comments explaining complex logic
- A CHANGELOG file to track version changes
- Examples of plugin output and configuration options

## Internationalization and Localization

- Use string externalization for all user-facing messages
- Support multiple languages through language resource files
- Use Unicode for character encoding
- Consider cultural differences in data formatting (e.g., date formats, number separators)
- Provide a mechanism for users to select their preferred language

## Plugin Output Examples

```json
{
  "name": "git",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "data": {
    "branch": "main",
    "commit": "abc123",
    "remotes": [
      {
        "name": "origin",
        "url": "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## More Detailed Examples

Here are some more detailed examples for different types of plugins:

1. File System Plugin
2. Database Plugin
3. Network Plugin


## Expanded Security Guidelines

- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper access controls
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Regularly audit and update security measures


## Plugin Testing and Validation

- Write unit tests for plugin functionality
- Implement integration tests
- Use fuzzing techniques for input validation
- Perform security audits


## Managing Plugin Dependencies

- Use a dependency management tool
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Minimize external dependencies
- Document all dependencies and their versions


## Plugin Discovery and Loading Process

1. Search for executables with 'ctx-' prefix in PATH
2. Verify plugin compatibility
3. Load plugin metadata
4. Initialize plugin with configuration
